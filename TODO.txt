* Move filtering into Blog model
* We'll need verification that it's actually an image, and a size cap on it as well, of course, but this is a great start.

Ok. In the Blog model, put something like:
@property
def image(self):
if self.image_location:
return self.image_location
return 'img/default.png'

* Add duplicate detection in the admin interface
* Add ability to specify multiple blogs per author
* Remove explicit schemas and name them based on the users (define users)
